# Dining-Philosophers-Problem
A program that allows 5 philosophers to think and eat. Each philosopher eats using 2 out of the 5 forks available. The program is uses semaphores for mutual exclusion amongst the philosophers, so that no two philosophers are using the same fork at the same time, and displays which philosopher is eating and when. The program also avoids deadlock and starvation and terminate 5 minutes after the first philosopher starts thinking.
